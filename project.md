**Background**
The informal economy in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) represents about 40% of the GDP of the region. It also represents 72% of the area’s total employment, and 93% of all new jobs added since the 90’s. The value of the informal sector in SSA is estimated to be $1 trillion. 

**The problem**
We highlight the use case of wastepickers (informal recyclers) to demonstrate our solution. There are roughly 1,200,000 pickers in Africa. Each picker walks around the city with a trolley collecting trash, and then sells this onto recycling companies for an income of roughly $5 a day. The pickers are not organized and are paid in cash by traders, which is problematic in a crime-ridden environment. The pickers also have no control over the price they get for the material they supply. 

**The Solution**
The product seeks to connect the local informal entrepreneur (picker) to the mainstream economy. It allows the pickers to organize into cooperatives that will enable them to more efficiently sell their material to traders in the formal recycling market. The cooperative is modeled after the DAO in principal, and ownership is split amongst the pickers. 

Materials collected are apportioned into categories and then sold in bulk to traders. The system utilizes a stablecoin EOS token, which is used in the transactions between the picker, the cooperative and the trader. The system tracks each picker’s contribution (using a smart contract) to the bulk sale, and rewards the picker according to his/her contribution. Each contribution to the bulk package can be tracked back to the picker, and a history is developed over time on the blockchain, enabling a reputation metric to be built. The cooperative can opt to keep a percentage of the proceeds in order to fund growth and shared infrastructure, as well as for loans to the pickers. 

**Key Objectives**
Increase picker safety with token payments.
Increase income with efficiency and organization.
Provide access to finance using “social collateral” and reputation profiling.
Give purpose, self-determination and self respect.
Work sensitively with communities so that the solution fits into their values and culture.
